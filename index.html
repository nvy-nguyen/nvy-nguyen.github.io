                            In two recent years, the whole world  has been raving non-stop since director Greta Gerwig teased about releasing the 'Barbie' movie. Nvy feels a bit alienated from the trend, since her childhood best-friend is the-one-and-only Licca-chan from TAKARATOMY, Japan.

This book is a constellation of videos, photographs, and paintings, exploring the ongoing legacy of the Vietnam-America War.

Having been through so many other corporate environments, Opensea stuck with Nvy as the dream team, full of young, inspiring go-getters.
